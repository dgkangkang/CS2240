      <h1><span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">Introduction to Internet</span> </h1>
      <p1>The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system. 
        Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the <span style ="color:rgb(18, 39, 230);font-weight:bold">ARPANET</span> (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet. <span style ="color:rgb(18, 39, 230);font-weight:bold">ARPANET</span> was a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department. In response to this, other networks were created to provide information sharing.

      <p1>January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (<span style ="color:rgb(18, 39, 230);font-weight:bold">TCP/IP</span>). This allowed different kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the <span style ="color:rgb(18, 39, 230);font-weight:bold">TCP/IP</span> standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language.
                                     
        <span style ="color:rgb(18, 39, 230);font-weight:bold">TCP/IP</span> stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. <span style ="color:rgb(18, 39, 230);font-weight:bold">TCP/IP</span> is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).

      <p1>Quick, instant mobile communications mainly shape today's development of the internet. People don't spend hours looking at computer screens. Instead, they use their mobile devices to stay online and connected everywhere, at all times. A lot of opportunities were created due to the development of the internet. Now, it's considered that people will struggle to survive and suffice their needs without the internet as well as the quality of information that people can access has dramatically improved along with the development of the internet as people can access all the kinds of communication with their devices on their hand.</p1>
